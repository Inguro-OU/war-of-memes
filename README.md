# 1. What is it?  

**TL;DR**: A cognitively trustworthy communication method for evolving ideas that multiply everyone's happiness.  

**More Detailed Explanation:**  

- **Trust** is the belief that someone or something is **worthy** of trust.  
- **Trustworthiness** is **actually being worthy** of that belief.
  
There are Four Types of Trustworthiness:
  
1. **Competence-Based Trustworthiness** – Interpersonal and based on proven skills and expertise in a specific field.  
2. **Affective Trustworthiness** – Interpersonal and based on sympathy and similarity.
3. **Cognitive Trustworthiness** – Interpersonal and based on fair treatment of people and their ideas, without prejudice.  
4. **Institutional Trustworthiness** – Institutional and often based on the institution's size, reputation, and brand.
 
- This method focuses on **interpersonal communication** that makes one **truly worthy** of other people's **belief** that they and their ideas will be treated fairly without prejudice.

# 2. How does it help you?

**TL;DR**: It helps those who use this method to predictably **increase the chance** of experiencing **trustworthy behaviors** and **decrease the chance** of experiencing **untrustworthy behaviours**. 

What are these **trustworthy** and **untrustworthy** behaviors? Imagine a particular college friend, partner, family member, or stranger. Do you **agree** or do you **disagree** with the following eight statements? 

### Trustworthy and untrustworthy communication

**Do you agree or disagree?**

👉 **Active Listening:** Your college, friend, family member, or even stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when she gives you the feeling that she understands your perspective.
- **Less worthy** of your trust when she doesn’t answer, breaks communication, and intentionally ignores your perspective

👉 **Critical Thinking:** Your college, friend, family member, or even stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when she admits the possibility of being wrong, recognizes her mistakes, and changes her opinion when presented with objectively better evidence.
- **Less worthy** of your trust when she refuses to admit the possibility of being wrong, denies or ignores her mistakes, and clings to her opinions even when faced with objectively better evidence.

👉 **Improvisation & Exploration:** Your college, friend, family member, or even stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when she helps you explore and expand your ideas, uncover new possibilities, and refine them together.
- **Less worthy** of your trust when she dismisses your ideas, sticking rigidly to those already familiar to them, avoiding creative risks, and limiting exploration.

### Trustworthy and untrustworthy behaivors

👉 **Statement 4:** Your college, friend, family member, or even stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when she keeps her promises despite her high cost.
- **Less worthy** of your trust when she makes promises she intends to break.

👉 **Statement 5:** Your college, friend, family member, or even stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when she tells you the truth despite her high cost.
- **Less worthy** of your trust when she intentionally lies to you when it serves her interests.

👉 **Statement 6:** Your college, friend, family member, or even stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when she looks decades ahead and considers the long-term effects of her actions
- **Less worthy** of your trust when she doesn’t look ahead and ignores the long-term effects of her actions.

👉 **Statement 7:** Your college, friend, family member, or even stranger is:

- **More worthy** of your trust when she empowers others to be more trustworthy.
- **Less worthy** of your trust when she ignores when people behave in an untrustworthy way.

# 3. Consequences of untrustworthy communication:

1. How often do you personally experience untrustworthy behaviors from the statements above?
2. How often do you personally behave in an untrustworthy way?
3. How would you feel if your colleagues, friends, family members, or even strangers behave trustworthy, even with people you don’t like or disagree with?

### 🛑 **Personal Challenges**

- Problems become harder to solve, mistakes accumulate, earning potential declines
- Self-doubt and mental blocks limit potential and growth.
- Soft skills—like active listening, negotiation, or collaboration—stagnate.

### 🛑 **Social Challenges**

- Relationships suffer when people violate the “silver rule,” treating others in ways they wouldn’t like to be treated themselves.
- Conflicts persist over what’s true or false, right or wrong.
- Misunderstanding becomes the norm, creating a spiral of isolation and disconnection.

### 🛑 **Work Challenges**

- Collaboration breaks down, knowledge-sharing and feedback loops disappear.
- Mistrust diminishes the collective problem-solving capacity.
- Instead of the best ideas winning, the loudest or most powerful voices dominate.

## **Your Benefits**

By reinforcing **Case A trust-building behaviors** and minimizing **Case B's trust-breaking behaviors**, participants unlock advantages across three domains:

🔹**Personal Gains**

1. Increase your problem-solving capacity and, as a result, your earnings potential
2. Reduce the number of mistakes you make
3. Overcome your mental blocks and challenges more effectively
4. Increase your objective trustworthiness
5. Improve your soft skills (e.g., active listening, communication, sales, negotiation, persuasion, critical thinking, and more)

🔹**Social Gains**

1. Help the people close to you reduce the number of times they violate the Silver Rule by treating you in ways they wouldn’t want to be treated themselves.
2. Resolve epistemic conflicts (about what’s true and false) and moral conflicts (about what’s right or wrong) more effectively
3. Assess the objective trustworthiness of other people more effectively
4. Increase your capacity to trust others while minimizing the risk of being taken advantage of

🔹**Professional Gains**

1. Exchange knowledge and feedback more effectively
2. Accelerate trust-building between members of small and large teams
3. Enhance the problem-solving capacity of small and large teams
4. Spread the culture of idea meritocracy where the best ideas win regardless of their source

## Trustworthy Community

Trust-building communication is more than a skill—it’s the foundation of a **trustworthy community.** Membership in such a community requires individuals to:

- **Treat fellow members as you wish to be treated—by practicing Case A trust-building behaviors.**
- **Refrain from treating outsiders in ways you wouldn’t want to be treated—by avoiding Case B trust-breaking behaviors.**

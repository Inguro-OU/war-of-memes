# 1. What is it?

**TL;DR**: This is a cognitively trustworthy communication method for evolving ideas that **multiply everyone's happiness**.

In other words, this **communication method** makes its users **truly worthy** of the **belief** that they will treat other people and any ideas equitably and without prejudice. Here is a more detailed explanation of key concepts:

- **Trust** is the **belief** that an entity will act in a way that maximizes **everyone's happiness**, rather than prioritizing only their own or their group's.
- **Trustworthiness** is **being worthy** of that belief.
- There are four **types of Trustworthiness**:
1. **Competence-Based Trustworthiness** – Between **people** and based on proven skills and expertise in a specific field.
2. **Affective Trustworthiness** – Between **people** and based on sympathy and similarity.
3. **Cognitive Trustworthiness** – Between **people** and based on equitable treatment of people and their ideas, without prejudice.
4. **Institutional Trustworthiness** – is based on the **institution's** size, reputation, and brand.

# 2. How does it help you?

**TL;DR**: This method helps you reliably increase the likelihood of experiencing **trustworthy** rather than **untrustworthy** communication.

### **Trustworthy Communication Habits**

Imagine the person described below being a particular college, friend, family member, or stranger. Do you **agree** or **disagree** with the following statements?

👉1. **Listen Actively**

- A person is **more** worthy of your trust if they make an effort to understand your perspective as you have it and ensure you feel understood.
- A person is **less** worthy of your trust if they disregard your perspective, make no effort to understand it, or fail to make you feel understood.

👉2. **Think Critically**

- A person is **more** worthy of your trust if they actively seek the strongest possible evidence that could prove their beliefs false, adjust their confidence in what they believe to be true based on that evidence, and admit their mistakes when the evidence requires it.
- A person is **less** worthy of your trust if they avoid seeking the strongest possible evidence that could prove their beliefs false, refuse to adjust their confidence in what they believe to be true based on that evidence or deny their mistakes when the evidence requires it.

👉3. **Explore creatively**

- A person is **more** worthy of your trust if they help you explore your ideas beyond familiar possibilities.
- A person is **less** worthy of your trust if they dismiss your ideas, limit discussion to what they already know and accept.

Let's **pause** here for a second and reflect:
1. How often do you experience **untrustworthy** communication from colleagues, friends, and strangers? How does it affect you?
2. How often do you communicate in an **untrustworthy** way with strangers, people of different cultures, or contrary beliefs? How does it affect your reputation? 
3. How do you feel when a person communicates in a **trustworthy** way, even with people from different cultures, and contrary beliefs?     

### **Core Trustworthy Values**

👉4. **Speak Honesty**

- A person is more worthy of your trust if they tell you the truth despite the high cost.
- A person is less worthy of your trust if they intentionally lie to you when it serves their interests.

👉5. **Keep Promises**

- A person is **more** worthy of your trust if they keep their promises despite the high cost.
- A person is **less** worthy of your trust if they make promises they intend to break.

👉6. **Think Long-Term**

- A person is **more** worthy of your trust if they look decades ahead and consider the long-term consequences of their actions.
- A person is **less** worthy of your trust if they fail to look ahead and ignore the long-term consequences of their actions.

👉7. **Develop Moral Character**

- A person is **more** worthy of your trust if they empower others to be more trustworthy.
- A person is **less** worthy of your trust if they tolerate untrustworthy behavior in others.

# 3. What are your benefits?

Consider the consequences of **untrustworthy communication**:

1. How often do you personally experience **untrustworthy communication** described in the seven statements above?
2. How often do you personally communicate or behave in an **untrustworthy** way?
3. How would **you feel** if your colleagues, friends, family members, and strangers behaved and communicated in a **more trustworthy way**, even with people they don't like or disagree with?
4. How would your colleagues, friends, family members, and strangers feel if **you** communicated and behaved in a **more trustworthy way**, even with people you don't like or disagree with?

### **Challenges due to untrustworthy communication**

🛑 **Personal Challenges**

- Problems become harder to solve, mistakes accumulate, earning potential declines
- Self-doubt and mental blocks limit potential and growth.
- Soft skills—like active listening, negotiation, or collaboration—stagnate.

🛑 **Social Challenges**

- Relationships suffer when people violate the “silver rule,” treating others in ways they wouldn’t like to be treated themselves.
- Conflicts persist over what’s true or false, right or wrong.
- Misunderstanding becomes the norm, creating a spiral of isolation and disconnection.

🛑 **Work Challenges**

- Collaboration breaks down, knowledge-sharing and feedback loops disappear.
- Mistrust diminishes the collective problem-solving capacity.
- Instead of the best ideas winning, the loudest or most powerful voices dominate.

### **Benefits due to trustworthy communication**

🔹**Personal Benefits**

1. Increase your problem-solving capacity and, as a result, your earnings potential
2. Reduce the number of mistakes you make
3. Overcome your mental blocks and challenges more effectively
4. Increase your objective trustworthiness
5. Improve your soft skills (e.g., active listening, communication, sales, negotiation, persuasion, critical thinking, and more)

🔹**Social Benefits**

1. Help the people close to you reduce the number of times they violate the Silver Rule by treating you in ways they wouldn’t want to be treated themselves.
2. Resolve epistemic conflicts (about what’s true and false) and moral conflicts (about what’s right or wrong) more effectively
3. Assess the objective trustworthiness of other people more effectively
4. Increase your capacity to trust others while minimizing the risk of being taken advantage of

🔹**Professional Benefits**

1. Exchange knowledge and feedback more effectively
2. Accelerate trust-building between members of small and large teams
3. Enhance the problem-solving capacity of small and large teams
4. Spread the culture of idea meritocracy where the best ideas win regardless of their source

🔹**Intrinsic needs**

Trustworthy communication is more than just a set of skills. It’s the foundation for human happiness because it fulfills essential human needs, including:

1. **Need for Belonging** – Feeling truly heard and understood.
2. **Need for Respect** – Being valued for our ideas and contributions.
3. **Need for Growth** – Expanding our knowledge and seeing reality more clearly.

Despite the importance of these universal human needs, many people feel isolated, unheard, and misunderstood. Ironically, trustworthy communication doesn’t rely on scarce resources—it multiplies when given. The real challenge? Most people lack the right habits, making their relationships and lives increasingly difficult.

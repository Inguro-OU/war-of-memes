[README](https://github.com/Inguro-OU/debiased-self/blob/main/README.md) to learn more about what it is, why it matters, and how it helps you.

## **Flexible Setup**

1. **Casual 1-on-1:** Once familiar with the game, participants can play the game on the fly for constructive responses.
2. **Small Group:** A small group of participants can play while seated around a table. 
3. **Events with Free Movement:** In events of any size, participants can move freely between groups and engage in one-on-one or small-group discussions.

---

## **Three Difficulty Levels**

The game offers three levels of participation to suit different group sizes and complexities:

1. **Basic Level:** includes core rules for casual groups or first-time participants.
2. **Intermediate Level:** adds structure with moderators and optional tools like idea cards. It is ideal for small groups around a table.
3. **Advanced Level:** includes expanded mechanics for deeper insights and competitive participation. It is suitable for small groups of experienced participants.

## **Core Rules**

### **1. Voluntary Participation**

- **Participation Badge**: participants wear a badge to signal participation.
- **Opt-Out Anytime**: Participants may remove their badge to exit their participation if they feel fatigued.

### **2. Armbands as Gifts & Rewards**

- **Starting Supply**: Each particpant begins with five **armbands** in their hand. Armbands can be considered gifts from other participants - they represent an opportunity for participants to demand trustworthy communication from each other.
- **Anti-Hoarding Rule**: A particpant may hold a maximum of **10 armbands**. Particpants must donate extra armbands.

### **3. Initiate a Challenge**  
1. To encourage trustworthy communication, a participant can call for a **challenge** by saying:  
- **"Listen Actively + [Name]"** - make a real effort to understand other's perspectives as they have them and ensure they feel understood.
- **"Think Critically + [Name]"**  - actively seek the strongest possible evidence that could prove your beliefs false, adjust your confidence in what you believe to be true based on that evidence, and admit your mistakes when the evidence requires it.
- **"Speak Honestly + [Name]"**  - share transparently what you believe to be true 

2. The challenger places an **armband** on the table, signaling an opportunity to earn it.
3. The challenged participant earns the **armband** if they successfully demonstrate the demanded aspect of trustworthy communication. The challenger gives the **armband** as recognition and says  **"Thank you + [Name]"**  

### 4. Give Up an Armband for Perceived Misunderstandings

1. A participant can **gives up an armband** when another participant **perceives** their communication as untrustworthy:

- **"Misunderstanding"** - they disregard your perspective, make no effort to understand it or fail to make you feel understood.
- **"Dogmatic"**  - they avoid seeking the strongest possible evidence that could prove their beliefs false, refuse to adjust their confidence in what they believe to be true based on that evidence, or deny their mistakes when the evidence requires it.
- **"Not transparent"** - they refused to transparently share their observations, feelings, and needs (as per the Non-Violent Communication Method)

2. If Participant A perceives Participant B's communication as untrustworthy, they **call it out.**
3. The participant B **must say "I'm sorry"** and **give up one armband.**
4. **Participant B does NOT have to agree with Participant A**— they only acknowledge that you perceived their communication as untrustworthy.

✅ **Example:**

- *"I feel like you didn’t understand me."*
- *Participant must say: "I'm Sorry"*

⚠️ **Safeguard to Prevent Misuse**

- A participant **cannot repeatedly call out the same person in a short period.**
- This prevents **overuse or weaponization** of the rule.

### **5. Voluntary Self-Challenge**

- Any participant may **spontaneously challenge himself**.
- If the other participant **perceives it as trustworthy communication**, they can reward the self-challenger with an **armband**.

---

## **Intermediate Rules (Optional)**

### **6. Idea Cards**

- A participant draws a card from a shared game deck.
- The card introduces an **idea** for discussion. Participants reflect, thinking (to themselves): “Which biases might I have?”

### **7. Declare Opinion**

- Participants verbally declare their opinion on the card. There are only two options: **True or** **False.** Participants can withhold declaring their opinion, indicating their uncertainty.
- If used at the table, the group can use **truth figures** and place them on the right option, expressing their opinion visually for others to see. Only one truth figure is allowed per participant per idea card.

### **8. Explain Opinion**

- If all participants agree on a given idea, they can move to the next card without explaining their opinion.
- If participants disagree, each participant has a set time (e.g., 1 minute) to explain the reasoning behind their opinion.

### **9. Moderator Role**

- Ensures **time limits** (e.g., 1 minute to explain an opinion, 2 minutes for active listening challenges).
- Resolves disputes and clarifies rules.
- Once experienced, moderators can improvise with topic-specific discussions, new game decks, and modified rules (e.g., as a warm-up before the game starts, participants could celebrate sharing a recent past mistake while taking full responsibility for it without justifications).

---

## **Advanced Rules (Optional)**

### **10. Bring Your Deck**

- Participants may create their own cards and bring them to the game.
- Each card’s backside may list the topic.
- Participants can draw from another participant rather than the main deck.
- Recommended tool: Use [Custom GPT to refine your ideas](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-676ec9d174608191a176779173a7a9e2-idea-refiner-for-war-of-memes) before writing them on a card.

### **11. Create Cards on the Fly**

- Participants can express their ideas by writing them on a new card mid-game. We recommend that each participant create a new card if they disagree with a given idea to explain their position in a short, clear way.
- Any card in play must have **at least one participant** validating it as true. Otherwise, it goes to the **“Graveyard.”**
- Others can declare their opinion **True or False** (via truth figures or verbally).
- Participants can choose whether to **allow** or **prohibit** their name from appearing on new cards (e.g., “Edward misunderstands confirmation bias”).

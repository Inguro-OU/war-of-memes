[README](https://github.com/Inguro-OU/debiased-self/blob/main/README.md) to learn more about what it is, why it matters, how it helps you and how it works.

## **1. How Ego Undermines Trust?**

At the root of untrustworthy communication is **ego**—the mind’s instinct to protect its self-image. It resists being wrong, defends its identity, and clings to beliefs even when evidence contradicts them. When ego feels threatened, it distorts reality, rejects change, and fuels division.

Trust requires openness. However, trust weakens when people defend their identity over truth, **and meaningful dialogue breaks down.** Instead of admitting mistakes, they double down on falsehoods—making trust fragile when needed most.

Humans evolved to **cooperate within groups,** not to ensure fairness **between them.** Instincts like **fairness, reciprocity, and loyalty** balance self-interest with group survival. But they were never designed to build trust **across different groups**—outsiders were often seen as threats.

## **2. Why Do Our Moral Instincts Struggle Today?**

For most of history, people lived in **stable, close-knit groups** where trust formed naturally. **Shared culture, environment, and knowledge** reinforced cooperation. Moral instincts evolved to **curb selfishness** and strengthen **group loyalty**—but they were built for stability, not rapid change.

Today, identities are fluid. People shift between communities, ideologies, and careers more than ever. **What once anchored trust—stable group membership—is now unstable.** Moral instincts, designed for cohesion, struggle to adapt to a world where loyalties constantly shift.

**Social mobility and access to new knowledge** blur group boundaries. Any group insider once seen as **"one of us"** may quickly become **"one of them."** Instincts that once strengthened unity now fuel division.

When identities are unstable, **trust is harder to sustain.** The instincts that once bound groups together must evolve to keep up with a changing world.

## **3.** What are Cognitive Biases?

Humans have over [**200 cognitive biases**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)—mental shortcuts shaped by evolution. While once useful for survival, these biases now fuel misinformation and division. Three of the most dangerous and self-reinforcing are:

- **Confirmation Bias** – Seeking information that supports our beliefs while ignoring contradictions.
- **Myside Bias** – Judging ideas based on group identity rather than merit.
- **Naïve Realism** – Assuming we see reality objectively while others are biased.

Because biases operate **below conscious awareness**, they make harmful ideas feel natural and resist correction. To be truly trustworthy communicators, we must recognize and overcome cognitive biases - this is called debiasing.

The foundation of effective debiasing is recognizing human imperfection. We all have cognitive biases, meaning **we all make mistakes**. The most dangerous mistake is assuming any **belief, tradition, or ideology is beyond error**.

Acknowledging our fallibility creates space for **continuous learning, improvement, and critical thinking**—key tools for resisting harmful memes.

## 4. What Is a Meme?

Humans naturally copy behaviors, ideas, and patterns—like children imitating words or actions. This copying forms the basis of [**memetic theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics), which explains how culture spreads and evolves.

Most people think of memes as jokes or GIFs, but these are the most visible examples. Memes include **words, ideas, thoughts, traditions, behaviors, and practical knowledge**—from driving a car to generating electricity. Every interaction involves memes, shaping our thoughts and actions.

We often believe we choose which memes to adopt, but memes behave like **self-replicating entities**, competing for survival in human minds. A useful meme—like how to cook food—spreads because it helps people. A fun meme spreads through entertainment, like a joke or dance.

Like genes in biological evolution, memes **replicate, mutate, and compete** for attention and adoption. We naturally adopt memes from those we **trust** and **admire**, reinforcing their spread. Understanding meme transmission helps us **control their impact**—whether positive or harmful.

## 5. Three Types of Meme Fitness

A meme’s ability to spread is called its **fitness**. It can be categorized into three types:

- **Classical Meme Fitness** – A meme survives by replicating itself widely, whether beneficial or not.
- **Local Meme Fitness** – A meme benefits an individual or group but may harm others.
    - **Example in Time**: A lying meme may help someone avoid immediate consequences (e.g., deceit in politics).
    - **Example in Space**: A warlike meme may help a group gain power but cause broader harm (e.g., xenophobia).
- **Global Meme Fitness** – A meme benefits humanity in the long run.
    - **Example**: The meme of **human rights** aligns with global fitness.

Understanding meme fitness helps us **filter out harmful memes** while promoting those aligned with long-term well-being.

## 6. There Are No Evil People, Only Harmful Memes

From a meme’s perspective, survival depends on being **adopted and spread**. Some memes thrive because they benefit humanity (e.g., human rights), while others spread despite being **harmful** (e.g., false beliefs, divisive ideologies).

Harmful memes have **high local fitness and negative global fitness**, meaning they offer **short-term advantages** to individuals or groups but harm humanity in the long run. As Mark Twain noted, *“The problem isn’t that we know too little—it’s that we know things that aren’t true.”* False beliefs persist because they are **easier to adopt than challenge**.

By shifting blame from individuals to the **harmful memes they carry**, we can focus on eliminating destructive patterns of thought and behavior rather than vilifying people.

## 7. Role of Two Cognitive Systems in Memetics

The [**System 1 and System 2** framework from Kahneman and Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) explains two complementary modes of human cognition:

- **Fast Thinking (System 1):** Efficient, automatic, habitual, and effortless—ideal for routine tasks and quick decisions. Responsible brain regions: amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and basal ganglia
    - **Memetic Role:** System 1 stores and reinforces existing memes within individuals. These memes include habits, ideas, and cultural patterns that define the self. Fast thinking favors memes that fit well with what is already known and resists those that challenge the status quo.
- **Slow Thinking (System 2):** Flexible, analytical, deliberate, and useful for solving complex problems with high uncertainty. Responsible brain regions: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
    - **Memetic Role:** System 2 enables creating, selecting, and adopting memes that offer long-term benefits but may conflict with existing beliefs or habits.

By strengthening **System 2 thinking**, we can shift from **egoistic selection** (favoring short-term, group-serving memes) to meme evolution through **humanistic selection** (promoting memes that benefit humanity).

## 8. How Do We Eliminate Harmful Memes

In memetics theory, ideas evolve through **replication, mutation, and selection**. We can accelerate this evolution by strengthening three key mental faculties represented by:

- **Listen actively** – supports accurate **meme replication**.
- **Think critically** – supports **meme selection**.
- **Explore creatively** – supports **meme mutation**.

Together, Active listening, Critical thinking, and Creative Exploration form a practical framework for debiasing. Strengthening these habits is the basis of trustworthy communication. It helps us to evolve memes that multiply everyone’s happiness.

## 9. How To Uncover Good Memes

Good memes are **anti-fragile**—the more they are challenged, the stronger they become. If an idea thrives despite intense scrutiny, it’s likely valuable. Like scientific theories, good memes **withstand falsification attempts** and make useful predictions. If disproving a meme fails despite rigorous effort, it signals truth and long-term utility. Bad memes collapse when exposed to evidence; good memes **adapt, persist, and illuminate reality**. Seeking truth means testing memes ruthlessly—only those that **benefit humanity, in the long run,** will shine.

## 10. Vision: Increasing trustworthiness between groups

- **Our vision** is a world where violations of the Silver Rule—“Do not treat others in ways you don’t want to be treated”—are increasingly rare, even across cultures and distances.
- **Our goal:**
    - **Lower the cost of assessing cognitive trustworthiness**—a person’s ability to think and act with moral and epistemic impartiality.
    - **Increase incentives for cognitive trustworthiness**—enabling people to build reputations based on promise-keeping, active listening, and critical thinking.
    - **Debiasing** should be considered a **human right**. Just as food security is a right because hunger causes suffering, access to debiasing methods (e.g., this one) is crucial because cognitive biases are at the root cause of our suffering.

- **Conclusion:** **Mistrust** is tearing at the fabric of our world, dividing societies, fueling conflict, and stifling progress. Challenges like **climate change**, **misinformation**, and **geopolitical tensions** demand an extraordinary response: **trust**. Trust is **transformative**—it restores connection, inspires action, and unlocks shared purpose. A future without trust is one of **scarcity** and **despair**, while a future with trust unlocks **progress and possibility**.
